# NVIDIA vGPU Driver Archive

> A community-driven archive of NVIDIA vGPU drivers for preserving hardware usability.


Every year, millions of enterprise-grade GPUs enter the consumer market as hardware cycles out of data centers. With the rise of AI competition, this flow is accelerating. Yet without proper drivers, much of this hardware risks becoming functionally useless or digital waste â€” especially for older platforms where official resources are scarce.

NVIDIA's vGPU drivers are locked behind paywalls and limited trials, with growing restrictions on public access. We believe this trend endangers the long-term usability of otherwise capable hardware.

This project exists as a hobbyist effort to **preserve, archive, and categorize NVIDIA vGPU drivers** for reference and community use. Our goal is to ensure that valuable hardware remains usable, and knowledge remains accessible, in the face of artificial scarcity.

- Collect and categorize available NVIDIA vGPU drivers.
- Help enthusiasts and independent researchers keep older hardware usable.
- Provide a public record of drivers for platforms that are no longer supported.
